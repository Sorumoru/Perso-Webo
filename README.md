# Perso Webo
Hi! You're looking at the codebase for my personal website! You can check the website [here](https://perso-webo.web.app/).

For this website, I challenged myself to see what I could create with just simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My main objective was to refresh my knowledge and skills with the basics since the last time I built a website from scratch was almost a year before this one. Although I am a recent graduate, I felt that going back to the basics would be a useful exercise. Despite having limitations, I had a lot of fun making this website and I plan to continue working on it whenever inspiration strikes.

I've been playing quite a bit of Valorant lately and one character there, Chamber, uses a card to bring out his utilities in the game. His card's design is what I initially wanted the website to look like. I wanted my website to look a lot like a business card, since I feel like in the tech world a personal website is kind of like your own business card. It's a gateway for anyone checking your website to your socials while at the same time showing off your skills first hand. 

### Built With
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- Hosted using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

## Acknowledgements
- I took heavy inspiration from [Ian Dunkerley's website](https://dunks1980.com/), *maybe even a bit too inspired*, but it showed me that your personal website doesn't have to be the most complex thing you've ever created. I liked its simplicity.
- [Dosis](https://github.com/googlefonts/dosis-vf) is the font I used for the texts.
- [@faizh27](https://github.com/faizh27) for keeping me accountable and my mentality in check. Also gave me feedback.
