              I've always been interested in technology, computers, and video games, and I feel incredibly fortunate to
              have chosen a career that allows me to pursue my passions relating to my interests. I am excited to share

            <p class="description">
              UX Was Here is a <b>social networking platform</b> that allows users to connect with like minded
              individuals wanting to share user experience and design ideas. Users can create their own profiles, upload
              posts with images, connect with others, as well as a messaging system for private conversations. The
              website was built on <b>React</b> and <b>HTML/CSS/Javascript</b>, and using <b>Firestore Firebase</b> for
              the back-end database.
            </p>
            <p>
              I <b>guaranteed open communication</b> with the client and provided guidance to my group of 4 to ensure
              smooth
              progress and a successful outcome. I also focused on <b>implementing seamless front-end and back-end
                communication</b> of the website by <b>utilizing React</b>. This was applied to key pages such as the
              user
              profile,
              messaging, and admin sections to enhance the user experience. Unfortunately the git repository is private
              for this project.

            <p class="description">
              Pugna Ultima is a 2D multiplayer fighting game created with <b>Unity and Photon Engine's Fusion</b>
              networking library, with a team of 15 following <b>industry-standard software development practices.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              As a <b>co-leader</b> of a sub-group of six, I <b>oversaw the design and development</b> of the core
              mechanics, including character movement, attacks, and <b>multiplayer integration.</b> I ensured that all
              of our code met Unity's coding norms by reviewing and integrating contributions from team members and
              ensuring the seamless integration of scripts and components. By <b>promoting clear communication</b> and
              adhering to coding standards, I contributed to the successful development of Pugna Ultima. Despite project
              challenges, we delivered a playable game on time.

              Although I've faced some challenges with my CS projects, I've learned to keep going and push myself
              further. While I haven't yet had the chance to show off any major work, I'm always working on new and
              exciting projects to improve my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please note that the projects showcased in my portfolio are the ones that I have completed and feel
              confident in sharing. While I have worked on other projects, some are still in progress or do not meet the
              standards I hold myself to. As I continue to develop my skills, I look forward to adding more completed
              projects to my portfolio.
