              My name is <b>Jun Earl Solomon</b> I'm a recent graduate of the British Columbia Institute of Technology's
              Computer Systems Technology program.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've always been interested in technology, computers, and video games, and I feel incredibly fortunate to
              have chosen a career that allows me to pursue my passions relating to my interests. I am excited to share
              with you the projects that I worked on, which demonstrates my skills and commitment to the field.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a proud Filipino, I strive to incorporate my cultural background into my work and use technology to
              make a positive impact in my community.

            <p class="description">
              UX Was Here is a social networking platform that allows users to connect with like minded individuals
              wanting to share user experience and design ideas. Users can create their own profiles, upload posts with
              images, connect with others, as well as a messaging system for private conversations. The website was
              built on React and HTML/CSS, and using Firestore Firebase for the back-end database.
            </p>
            <p>
              I worked on ensuring a seamless communication with the client as well as guiding my group of 4 during the
              3-month long project. I also worked on the user profile page
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately the repository is private for this project.

              Although I've faced some challenges with my CS projects, I've learned to keep going and push myself
              further. While I haven't yet had the chance to show off any major work, I'm always working on new and
              exciting projects to improve my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please note that the projects showcased in my portfolio are the ones that I have completed and feel
              confident in sharing. While I have worked on other projects, some are still in progress or do not meet the
              standards I hold myself to. As I continue to develop my skills, I look forward to adding more completed
              projects to my portfolio.
